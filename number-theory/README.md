In this repository you can find a many scripts that is used to solve the most popular problems in this area ,such as:

**Binary Exponenciation**

**Fast Modular Exponenciation**

**Great Common Divisor (GCD)**

**Least Common Multiple**

**Primality Test**

**Prime factor decomposition**

**Sieve of Erastothenes**
